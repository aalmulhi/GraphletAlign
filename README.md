# GraphletAlign
Network Alignment using Graphlet Signatureand High Order Proximity

### Overview
In this work, we develop a novel topology-based network alignment approach which we call GraphletAlign.  The  proposed  method  uses  graphlet  signature  as  nodeattributes and then uses a bi-partite matching algorithm for obtainingan initial alignment, which is later refined by considering higher-ordermatching.

### Requirements

### Running The Code and Input Format 
1. To add noise to the graph run the following: <br />
python noise_p.py graph_file noise_percentage <br />
2. To generate the graphlet frequencies using Orca Tool: <br />

3. To run GraphletAlign code use the following command :<br />
