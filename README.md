# GraphletAlign
Network Alignment using Graphlet Signatureand High Order Proximity

# Overview
In this work, we develop a novel topology-based network alignment approach which we call GraphletAlign.  The  proposed  method  uses  graphlet  signature  as  nodeattributes and then uses a bi-partite matching algorithm for obtainingan initial alignment, which is later refined by considering higher-ordermatching.
